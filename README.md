# Simple task manager Web App with Vulnerabilities

A simple task manager app with a RESTful API and a web-based user interface. This app is intentionally vulnerable to various security vulnerabilities, and is intended for use in demos and educational materials only. Please do not use this app in production environments.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- Git
- Visual Studio Code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd task-manager
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```


## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Open the app in a web browser:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## API

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /tasks`: get a list of all tasks
- `POST /tasks`: create a new task
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: update an existing task
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: delete a task by ID

Each task object has the following properties:

- `id` (string): the unique ID of the task
- `title` (string): the title of the task
- `description` (string): the description of the task

To make requests to the API endpoints, use the following base URL:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


For example, to create a new task, send a `POST` request to the following URL:
[http://localhost:3000/tasks](http://localhost:3000/tasks)

with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "title": "Example task",
  "description": "This is an example task"
}
